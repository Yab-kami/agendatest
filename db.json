    "body":"<p>The vision of Agenda 2063 was launched under the leadership of H.E Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, First Female Chairperson of the African Union Commission (AUC) since the creation of the OAU now the AU</p>\n""+""\n""+""<p>Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 6 May 2016: Agenda 2063, which is part of the pan-African struggles for unity, self-determination, freedom, progress and collective prosperity that started over centuries ago, is a shared framework for inclusive growth and sustainable development to be realized by 2063. It was agreed upon by the African leaders in 2013 during the 50th Anniversary of the Organization of African Unity (OAU); the context in which it should be situated.</p>\n""+""\n""+""<p>Since 2012, and in preparation for the commemoration of the 50th OAU Anniversary, the AU Heads of State and Government declared 2013 to be the year of Pan-Africanism and African Renaissance. The aim was to provide an opportunity to reflect on its past, re-kindle its ideals and plan for better future of Africa and its people.</p>\n""+""\n""+""<p>The move was urged by the fact that when the OAU was established in 1963, there were many challenges that had first to be overcome. Almost half of the continent was still under colonialism; relations with regional groupings (now Regional Economic Communities&mdash;RECs) and other institutions, such as the United Nations Economic Commissions, had not been laid down and strengthened, while member states had not been internally well organized. In addition, African countries had no experience in running such first continental organization. Hence, there was no common vision on how to pursue OAU&rsquo;s objectives, particularly the African unity agenda. As a result, there was no clear strategy on how to advance Pan-Africanism and African Renaissance; and many blueprints and plans that the OAU put in place were not well conceived. For instance, they did not include important elements such as reliable sources of funding, constant monitoring and evaluation and so on; the situation that led many of them to be ineffectively executed with undesired results.</p>\n""+""\n""+""<p>By 2013, the African Union (AU) found itself in a new conducive environment for advancing the socio-economic development and integration of the continent through a long-term planning. By then, colonialism had been greatly defeated and apartheid dismantled. Member states were better organized with major advances in many areas such as good governance and conflict management and resolution. In addition, relations with RECs and other institutions have been improved and the former had been made AU pillars. Above all, member states had agreed on a common vision &ldquo;to build an integrated, prosperous and peaceful Africa, driven and managed by its own citizens and representing a dynamic force in the global arena.&rdquo; Moreover, good experience had been gained from running continental blueprints, like the New Partnership for Africa&rsquo;s Development (NEPAD); and there have emerged other new factors to Africa&rsquo;s advantage. They include development and investment opportunities that had started seeing many African countries economically booming; emergence of new international alliances like BRICS composed of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa; and the general changing universal context of globalization and revolution in information technology etc. Therefore, the AU was better placed to develop a long-term strategy that would harmonize national, regional and continental plans and frameworks to realize its objectives.</p>\n""+""\n""+""<p>Consequently, in 2013 during the OAU Golden Jubilee, the African leaders adopted the 50th Anniversary Solemn Declaration in which they decided to develop a Continental Agenda 2063 with clear priority areas to be realized in the next fifty years through a people-driven process.</p>\n""+""\n""+""<p>In overall, Agenda 2063 was intended to be a well-conceived continental plan built on the previous and existing plans from national to continental levels, pursued through new thinking and ways of operation using modern techniques to realize the AU&rsquo;s common vision coming the next fifty years, when the AU member states will be celebrating the OAU Centenary.</p>",

"title":"AU Hosts High Level Side Event on Implementing Agenda 2063 and Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development",
"date":"24 September 2014",
"body":"<p><strong>New York, USA &ndash; 21 September 2016:</strong> The African Union Commission (AUC) today hosted a high level joint side event in conjunction with the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), NEPAD Planning and Coordinating Agency (NPCA), the African Development Bank (AFDB) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) -Regional Bureau for Africa to discuss the modalities of effecting an integrated approach to implementing Africa&rsquo;s Agenda 2063 and the Global 2030 Agenda.</p>\n""+""\n""+""<p>The meeting which was held on the side lines of the 71st session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) was chaired by the AUC Deputy Chairperson, H.E. Mr. Erastus Mwencha and was attended by high-ranking government officials, heads of Pan African Organizations, heads of international organisations as well as development partners and key stakeholders.</p>\n""+""\n""+""<p>In his opening remarks, H.E. Mr. Mwencha highlighted the fact that Africa proactively contributed to the global agenda by formulating a Common African Position (CAP) on the Post 2015 Development Agenda which was preceded by broad consultations across the continent and that Africa was the only region that had developed a document which represented a united African voice in the formulation of the SDGs. This document greatly influenced the work of the Open Working Group on the SDGs and the Intergovernmental Negotiations on the post-2015 development Agenda. As a result, there is a high degree of convergence between the continent&rsquo;s priorities, as embodied in the African Union&rsquo;s Agenda 2063 and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of Agenda 2030; and this calls for coherent implementation of both agendas by African Member States.&rdquo;</p>\n""+""\n""+""<p>During the meeting, the Commissioner for Economic Affairs H.E. Dr. Anthony Mothae Maruping moderated a panel of distinguished representatives to discuss various perspectives on implementing Agenda 2063 and Agenda 2030. The panel consisted of representatives from UNECA, AFDB, NEPAD, UNFPA FEMNET UNDP and the UN Office of the Special Adviser on Africa (OSAA)</p>\n""+""\n""+""<p>Reflecting on the recent trends on the MDGs the Executive Secretary of UNECA Dr. Carlos Lopes called on African States to accelerate efforts to diversify their economies and add value to their primary commodities so as to expand decent employment opportunities for their population.&rdquo; Mr. Alberic Kacou of the AFDB reiterated the Bank&rsquo;s support for the implementation of the two agendas and observed that &ldquo;the institution&rsquo;s priorities as reflected in the High 5s provide substantial leverage for the implementation of the SDGs and Agenda 2063.&rdquo; Mr. Odusola of UNDP Regional Bureau for Africa underlined their &ldquo;commitment to strengthening the capacities of countries to implement the two agendas.&rdquo;</p>\n""+""\n""+""<p>The meeting concluded with the launch of two reports: the <strong>MDG to Agenda 2063 /SDG Transition Report</strong> <strong>2016 and Africa Economic Outlook Report 2016. </strong>The transition report takes stock of Africa&rsquo;s performance on the MDGs to date and reflects on the challenges and opportunities associated with the transition to Africa&rsquo;s continental Agenda 2063 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.</p>\n""+""\n""+""<p>The transition report also highlights important strides made by the continent in: improving net primary enrolment; enhancing gender equality and empowerment of women; reducing child mortality; combating the spread of HIV and AIDS; and ensuring environmental sustainability.</p>\n""+""\n""+""<p>To ensure effective implementation of the two Agendas, the transition report highlights the need for countries to strengthen capacities for evidence-based policy-making and to improve institutional coordination.</p>\n",
