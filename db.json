Almost half of the continent was still under colonialism; relations with regional groupings (now Regional Economic Communities&mdash;RECs) and other institutions, such as the United Nations Economic Commissions, had not been laid down and strengthened, while member states had not been internally well organized. In addition, African countries had no experience in running such first continental organization. Hence, there was no common vision on how to pursue OAU&rsquo;s objectives, particularly the African unity agenda. As a result, there was no clear strategy on how to advance Pan-Africanism and African Renaissance; and many blueprints and plans that the OAU put in place were not well conceived.

In addition, relations with RECs and other institutions have been improved and the former had been made AU pillars.

Mr. Mwencha highlighted the fact that Africa proactively contributed to the global agenda by formulating a Common African Position (CAP) on the Post 2015 Development Agenda which was preceded by broad consultations across the continent and that Africa was the only region that had developed a document which represented a united African voice in the formulation of the SDGs. This document greatly influenced the work of the Open Working Group on the SDGs and the Intergovernmental Negotiations on the post-2015 development Agenda. As a result, there is a high degree of convergence between the continent&rsquo;s priorities, as embodied in the African Union&rsquo;s Agenda 2063 and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of Agenda 2030; and this calls for coherent implementation of both agendas by African Member States.&rdquo;</p>\n""+""\n""+""<p>During the meeting, the Commissioner for Economic Affairs H.E.

"title":"Stakeholder Engagement meeting on ‘Capacity imperatives for Agenda 2063’",
"date":"May 12, 2016",
"body":"<p><strong>Addis Ababa, May 11</strong>: The African Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF) and the African Union Commission (AUC) will hold a Stakeholder Engagement Meeting on 12-13 May 2016 at the African Union Commission HQ, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia themed “Capacity Imperatives for Agenda 2063.”</p><p>The meeting will draw representation from various stakeholders in the capacity development sector including Governments and their development partners.</p><p>Agenda 2063 - “The Africa We Want” is the indigenous African Strategic Framework agreed upon by African Heads of States and Governments through the African Union. The framework was built around seven key aspirations:</p><ul><li>A prosperous Africa, based on inclusive growth and sustainable development;</li><li>An integrated continent politically united and based on the ideals of Pan-Africanism and the vision of an African Renaissance;</li><li>Rule of law;</li><li>A peaceful and secure Africa;</li><li>An Africa with a strong cultural identity, common heritage, values and ethics;</li><li>An Africa whose development is people driven, relying on the potential offered by African people, particularly women and youth, and caring for children;</li><li>An Africa that can stand as a strong and influential global player and partner.</li></ul><p>According to the African Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF), the successful implementation of Agenda 2063 requires a strategic approach that prioritizes key capacity challenges that, if addressed, can unlock the continent’s true potential. Professor Emmanuel Nnadozie the Executive Secretary of ACBF has previously iterated that, “There has been a lack of confidence among some Africans in their capacity to develop the continent. However, development of Africa through partnership and a concerted effort can be achieved.”</p><p>The main purpose of the upcoming workshop will be to examine and validate the major points and recommendations that are emerging from the capacity assessment review documents produced by the ACBF, including (i) Capacity Requirements for Agenda 2063; (ii) African critical technical skills: A key Capacity dimension needed for implementing programmes in the first ten years of Agenda 2063; (iii) Capacity Development Plan Framework. Key findings of the review process include the shortcomings of our education systems; the need for critical technical skills and capacities; and the need for change in institutional architecture and legislative frameworks.</p><p>The Report on the “Capacity Requirements for Agenda 2063” informs that the capacity required for a successful implementation of Agenda 2063 are clustered into four main categories, namely (1) operational capacity for holistic and effective results (this includes institutional and human capacity as well as systems and work processes); (2) change and transformative capacities (which includes transformative leadership, change readiness, ability for mind-set shifts, and ability to innovate); (3) composite capacity (which includes strategic planning, results-based management as well as organizational and coordination capability); and (4) critical, technical and sector-specific skills for implementing the 10 flagship projects under the First Ten Year Implementation Plan of Agenda 2063.</p><p>The study on the “African critical technical skills: A key Capacity dimension needed for implementing programmes in the first ten years of Agenda 2063” shows, among other findings, that:</p><ul><li>in terms of agriculture scientists and researchers, Africa might have a current projected gap of 1,611,042, and a projected number of 1,886,820 to aim for by 2023;</li><li>as a continent, Africa might have a current estimated gap of 2,827,703 water and sanitation engineers; the continent should aim for 3,152,025 by 2023; and</li><li>Africa might have a current projected gap of 7,441,648 engineers, and a projected number of 8,295,163 engineers to aim for by 2023</li></ul><p>The “Capacity Development Plan Framework” suggests that for major agenda of capacity development to take place as part of the implementation of Agenda 2063, it is estimated that 80 percent of the needed capacity development interventions could be initiated and carried out by various stakeholder group actors, while approximately 20 percent maybe placed under the responsibility of continental and regional institutions.</p><p>Prof Nnadozie adds, “The identification of capacity as a key strategic area has been one of the fundamental missing links with previous development efforts. As such, the implementation of Agenda 2063 will be based on a proper understanding of the capacity requirements and accompanied by a Capacity Development Planning Framework.”</p><p>The upcoming workshop will also deliberate on actionable decisions to be made as well as activities to be undertaken by key stakeholder groups for effective execution of a 10 year implementation plan of Agenda 2063.</p>",
